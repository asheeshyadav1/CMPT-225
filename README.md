# CMPT-225 Data Structures and Programming 

The repository you are currently reading consists of projects that I had to design and implement in my DSP class. In the following folders, you will see the use of many Data Structures such as Queues, Stacks, BST, Binary Heaps, etc. 

NOTE: Our assignments were treated like real-world tasks, where we were usually given a Header file with functions to implement. Our primary task was to implement each function accurately and ensure the program worked as instructed.
